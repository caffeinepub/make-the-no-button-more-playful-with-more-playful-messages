REQ-5 is partially evidenced (share URL helper and copy-related state/imports), but the diff summary does not provide direct evidence that the user-facing share/copy labels are in English.",

      "reason": "The diff summary indicates a new share/copy section exists, but the provided truncated snippet of ValentinePage does not show the actual rendered labels/text for the share/copy UI, so compliance with the English-only label requirement cannot be verified from the evidence shown.",
