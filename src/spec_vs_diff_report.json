      "requirement": "After clicking “Yes”, the success screen uses the same updated name (e.g., “Sanya baby ay” in “{name}, you're amazing! ✨”).",
      "reason": "The only shown change is a `name` constant in `ValentinePage.tsx` and its use in `submitResponse({ name, response: \"yes\" })`. The diff does not show how `SuccessMessage` receives/displays the name, and `frontend/src/components/SuccessMessage.tsx` is not shown as modified.",
