# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Valentine flow signature name to display “Sanya baby ay” consistently across the main card and success screen.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the displayed signature name on the main Valentine page from “Sanya” to “Sanya baby ay”.
- Ensure the success screen renders the same updated name and remove any remaining user-visible “Sanya” occurrences within the Valentine flow UI.

**User-visible outcome:** The Valentine card’s signature line shows “Sanya baby ay”, and after clicking “Yes” the success screen also displays “Sanya baby ay” consistently.
